# Thread Shed Challenge

This is a challenge project from Codecademy that asked me to iterate through the string provided and clean up the transaction data, and store all in the information in easier to access lists.

The purpose of this project is to reinforce my understanding of iterating and parsing string data to an easier to read format.
